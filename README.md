Implementing Naive Bayes Classifier as a single model for both Categorical and Numeric data from scratch in Python. Check this [video](https://youtu.be/1QulO1jS2Hk) for a refresher where I discuss the theory and application intuitively.

Weâ€™ll also get introduced to approaching Machine Learning imbalanced binary classification problem; Discussing topics like: Feature Engineering, K Fold Cross Validation and Model Evaluation using several tools and metrics (Precision, Recall. Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix).
